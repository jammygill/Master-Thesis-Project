The Pipeline was developed for doing differential expression analysis of NGS data.

PipeLine_for_DE_Seq_analysis_study.R is the main pipeline to study Differential Gene Expression (DE). 

creating_sample_table_naive.R helps to prepare the genomic datasets for input to perform DE analysis. 

goseq_analysis.R helps to perform Gene Ontology on DE genes. 

how_to_open_file_script.R gives the idea about opening different kind of file systems.
